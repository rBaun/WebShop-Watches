# WebShop-Watches
A project made with my study group, where the goal was to create a distributed system. This project is made with the focus on learning backend development, making the design a minor priority.
The main goal is to be setup communication with an administrative client, a public client for users and a server for the business logic and persistence. The administrative client is used for handling CRUD operations, such as creating a product, fixing a customers order, etc. The public client is made for users to be able to visit the webshop and buy the items they wish. The server handles the backend parts of the system.

The technologies used in this project, is as follows:
* C#
* .NET Framework
* WPF
* WCF with SOAP
* MSSQL
* Unit & Integration tests
* N-Layered Architecture
* Concurrency problems
